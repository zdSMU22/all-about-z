In this project I had to create a professional portfolio that included:
    * Name and recent photo
    * Links to sections about me, my work, and contact information
    * Displayed examples of previous work via tiled images with the first image being larger in size than the others
    * Hyperlinked image to the deployed Run Daddy application
    * Resizable to multiple screens and devices/reponsive layout

*Insert screenshots of computer layout*
